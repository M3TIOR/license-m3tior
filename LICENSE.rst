      Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise
      the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

      A.
         .. raw:: html
            <div id="s2a1A">
         .. raw:: html
            </div>

         reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part,
         for NonCommercial purposes only; and

      Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License

      authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
      formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make

      and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
      from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
      Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to
      circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
      Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this
      Section `2(a)(4) <#s2a4>`__ never produces Adapted Material.

         additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
         Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if

      held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You
      to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
   2.

      You may satisfy the conditions in Section `3(a)(1) <#s3a1>`__ in
      any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
--------------------------------------------

Where the Licensed Rights
include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the
Licensed Material:


a.
   .. raw:: html
      <div id="s4a">
   .. raw:: html
      </div>

   for the avoidance of doubt, Section `2(a)(1) <#s2a1>`__ grants You
   the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a
   substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial
   purposes only;

b.
   .. raw:: html
      <div id="s4b">
   .. raw:: html
      </div>

   if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
   in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
   database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
   individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c.
   .. raw:: html
      <div id="s4c">
   .. raw:: html
      </div>

   You must comply with the conditions in Section `3(a) <#s3a>`__ if You

does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the
Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

   You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
   or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
   consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
   or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
   Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
   such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
   liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
   apply to You.**


c.
   .. raw:: html
      <div id="s5c">
   .. raw:: html

      <div id="s6b">
   .. raw:: html
      </div>

   Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under

      upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section `6(b) <#s6b>`__ does not
   affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
   violations of this Public License.

c.
   .. raw:: html
      <div id="s6c">
   .. raw:: html
      </div>

   this Public License.

   .. raw:: html
      <div id="s6d">

      </div>

   Sections `1 <#s1>`__, `5 <#s5>`__, `6 <#s6>`__, `7 <#s7>`__, and
